<h1>P8332: Advanced Analytic Methods in Environmental Health Sciences</h1>
</ul><h2 id='course_description'>Course description</h2>
<br>This seminar course will introduce advanced methods and tools used in Environmental Health Sciences. <br><br>These topics include advanced regression techniques especially pertinent to environmental health, mixtures methods, Bayesian statistics, prediction and forecasting techniques, and attribution science in public health. <br><br>Each class will have two components: a lecture and a coding lab. <br><br>Although other courses in the School and other Departments might also present some of the methods covered here, the emphasis of this course will be on applications in EHS specifically and the appropriateness, assumptions, strength, limitations and interpretation of results in the EHS framework. R will be used for all coding, with GitHub for code and lecture material co-ordination.<br>
